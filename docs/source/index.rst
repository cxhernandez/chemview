Welcome to chemview's documentation!
====================================

chemview is an interactive molecular viewer designed for the IPython notebook. With chemview you can:

    - **Display** molecules and systems in an easy and efficient manner.
    - Look at those systems evolve in **time**. chemview is fast by design, updates on the properties are performed only when necessary.
    - Perform interactive data visualization in the IPython notebook.
    - Create new ways to visualize your data by using the flexible low-level API.

chemview is implemented using web technologies such as WebGL_ and `three.js <http://threejs.org>`_, giving chemview an **excellent multi-platform support**.
